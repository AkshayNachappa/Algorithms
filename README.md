# Algorithms in C++
In C++, the designation identifies a group of functions that run on a designated range of elements. 

The algorithms are used to solve problems or provide functionality. 

Algorithms work exclusively on values; they don't affect the size or storage of a container. 

Simple algorithms can be implemented within a function. 

Complex algorithms might require several functions or even a class to implement them.
